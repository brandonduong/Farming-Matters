\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}
Farming Matters is an interactive and engaging game where the user manages a farm. The goal of the game is to collect research data about risk-reward decisions from the users. The software will mask traditional conventions of conducting surveys and
lab experiments allowing users to make genuine decisions. The game decisions made by the users will be logged on the server and saved which can be later used for research.

\subsection{Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Build confidence in the software's correctness to match the gameplay consistency 
    \item Demonstrate suitable usability for users playing the game and data collection for research
    \item To assure the system has met the requirements provided in the Software Requirement Specification (SRS)
    \item To assure potential hazards are accounted for
\end{itemize}

\end{table}
Please note that all team members listed on the table will also have the role of code reviewers. This includes the supervisor, as he has to maintain the code in the future and should therefore have some oversight of the code itself.

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

SRS verification will be implemented in a variety of ways. First of all, reviews by classmates and teammates will be used in the form of the creation of GitHub Issues. Although this has been done before, we intend to continue verifying the SRS in this way. We will improve on the previous process by creating a checklist to guide a reviewer, to help improve the speed of reviews and guide reviewers towards areas that may need more attention. This checklist will be implemented in the form of a GitHub Issues template.

We will also use structured reviews from the project's supervisor to help verify the SRS. This will be carried out in the form of an SRS walkthrough, where all group members and the supervisor will meet and the group will guide the supervisor through the SRS document.

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

Design verification will be implemented very similarly to SRS verification. \\
Like in the preceding section, reviews by classmates and teammates will be used in the form of the creation of GitHub Issues. A checklist to guide reviewers will also be created, to help improve the speed of reviews and guide reviewers towards areas that may need more attention. This checklist will be implemented in the form of a GitHub Issues template.

We will also use structured reviews from the project's supervisor to help verify the design. This will be carried out in the form of a design walkthrough, where all group members and the supervisor will meet and the group will guide the supervisor through the design of the project, including drawing diagrams on a whiteboard and describing concepts in-depth where needed. The supervisor will be encouraged to give feedback during the walkthrough.

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

Verification and Validation Plan verification will be implemented very similarly to the preceding two sections. \\
Like in the preceding sections, reviews by classmates and teammates will be used in the form of the creation of GitHub Issues. A checklist to guide reviewers will also be created, to help improve the speed of reviews and guide reviewers towards areas that may need more attention. This checklist will be implemented in the form of a GitHub Issues template.

Due to the nature of the Verification and Validation plan, we elected to use other classmates for structured reviews as well as the supervisor. Since other classmates have a more technical background than our supervisor, these structured reviews will help us improve the VnV plan document. The review from the supervisor will be equally for his purposes, so he is familiar with how we are testing the project. These structured reviews will be carried out in the form of VnV plan walkthroughs, where all group members and the supervisor will meet and the group will guide the supervisor through the design of the project, including drawing diagrams on a whiteboard and describing concepts in-depth where needed. The supervisor will be encouraged to give feedback during the walkthrough.

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

  Implementation verification will be done using the dynamic and static tests outlined in this document. Namely, they consist of the tests for functional requirements in \hyperref[s5.1]{section 4.1} and the tests for nonfunctional requirements in \hyperref[s5.2]{section 4.2}. In future revisions of this document, unit tests from section 6 will also be used for implementation verification.
  
  Implementation verification will also be carried out through code reviews. When a group member makes a pull request to the GitHub repository, another member will have to approve it before it can be merged to the main (stable) branch.
  
  Finally, implementation verification will be carried out through a static analyzer. For now, this will just consist of running the linter used for the project (see \hyperref[s4.6]{section 3.6}). This can be set up either via GitHub Actions, or since the team size is small it may cost less time to simply require that all devs run the linter on their pull requests before opening them.

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}
\label{s4.6}

\begin{itemize}
\item For front-end testing, we will use \href{https://jestjs.io/}{Jest}. For back-end, we will use \href{https://mochajs.org/}{Mocha}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mocha is the most popular Javascript unit testing framework. It is designed to be simple, extensible, and fast. Mocha provides a lot of useful functionality out of the box such as fixtures, mocking, etc. It also provides a lot of features for async testing, which will be useful for testing back-end components that need to do async operations such as writing to a database (for example). 
    
    \item Jest is also very popular, however we will specifically use it for front-end testing as it provides a suite of useful features such as snapshot testing that can be used to ensure the layout of a page doesn't change.
\end{itemize}

\item For code coverage, we will use \href{https://istanbul.js.org/}{istanbul.js}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Istanbul.js is a very simple, lightweight code coverage tool that bundles and runs all unit tests with a single command. It generates a very readable and understandable output and prints it to the terminal. An example can be seen in the linked website. 
    \item Code coverage reports for the entire project will be generated as shown in Figure 1 below. \\
    \begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{CodeCoverage}
    \caption{A sample code coverage report}
    \end{figure}
\end{itemize}
\item CI will be set up using GitHub actions. The CI system will run automated tests triggered by a change to the main branch to ensure the main branch is always stable.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mocha and Jest both have the necessary features needed to automate testing with GitHub actions.
\end{itemize}

\item Linter: \href{https://prettier.io/}{prettier}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}


  One of the central purposes of this project is to gather research data through a user's gameplay. The supervisor, Prof. Niko Yiannakoulias, has done research before on the same topic, but through traditional survey methods instead of a game. The data obtained from his previous research will be important to validate the software, as it will help show if the software fulfilled its purpose of generating reliable data.
  \\ 

Another method of validating the software will be review sessions with our primary stakeholder, the supervisor (Prof. Niko Yiannakoulias). We have a weekly meeting cadence set up with him and we can use these to iteratively validate the software as we go through the development process as opposed to validating it just once. In the beginning, it will be best to keep these review sessions less formal but as the software gets closer to the finished product, the review sessions will become formal in nature and the group will implement task based inspection.

\section{System Test Description}
	
\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}
\label{s5.1}

% \wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
%   different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
%   level of document structure can be removed.} \\
Game testing can be broken down into the following sections. The subsections will cover all the different components of the game. These components will work operate separately or work together to fulfill the functional requirements. Some of the components will be tested manually while others will require automated testing.


\subsubsection{Account Testing}

% \wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
%   cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.  If a section
%   covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
%   table in the SRS.}
The account creation testing deals with the test cases related that relate to a user account. FR1, FR2, FR5 and FR15 are the functional requirements that are covered by the subsection. The system requires you to have an account to play the game. The test cases include the following: creating an account, resetting password, logging in, verifying if the user is human and account deletion.

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
  philosophy for test case selection.}  
\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}

Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

  be automatic}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed: 

\item{...\\}
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Module 2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}

\subsubsection{Module ?}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\subsection{Knowledge and skills - Reflection  }
\begin{enumerate} % Pretty much read up tutorials and watch youtube vids for how acquire knowledge and master skill
    \item \textbf{Jest}: Two approaches to acquiring this knowledge would be to complete an in-depth tutorial on \href{https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/jest-testing-tutorial/}{Jest Tutorial – JavaScript Unit Testing Using Jest Framework} and watching a video of a react testing tutorial using \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML5egqL3YFE}{React Testing Tutorial (Jest + React Testing Library)}. The team member will pursue following the in-depth tutorial as they will be able to learn the basics and apply these concepts when testing the backend.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Student: Mihail 
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mocha}: Two approaches to acquiring this knowledge would be to read documentation on \href{https://mochajs.org/}{Mocha} and following an in-depth tutorial \href{https://www.w3resource.com/mocha/getting-started.php}{Introduction to Mocha}. The team member will pursue following the in-depth tutorial as they will be able to learn the basics and apply these concepts when testing the front-end. They may refer to the documentation if they require knowledge not acquired in the tutorial.
        \begin{itemize}
                \item Student: Brandon
            \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Code Walkthroughs}: Two approaches to mastering and acquiring this knowledge would be to read a tutorial on \href{https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_testing_dictionary/code_walkthrough.htm}{code walkthroughs} and to try to apply this knowledge during a work session. The team member will read the tutorial to get a better understanding of the concept as there might not be sufficient time to properly perform code walkthroughs.
        \begin{itemize}
                \item Student: Mohammad 
            \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Static Testing}: Two approaches to mastering this skill would be to refer back to SFWRENG 3S03(Software Testing) notes on static testing and reading up on a \href{https://www.javatpoint.com/static-testing}{static testing tutorial}. The team member will refer to course notes as there are many examples covered in their notes.
        \begin{itemize}
                \item Student: Andrew 
            \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Testing}: Two approaches to mastering this skill would be to refer back to SFWRENG 3S03(Software Testing) notes on dynamic testing and reading up on \href{https://www.guru99.com/dynamic-testing.html}{dynamic testing tutorial}. The team member will refer to the tutorial as their notes do not contain as much information as the tutorial.
