\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}
Farming Matters is an interactive and engaging game where the user manages a farm. The goal of the game is to collect research data about risk-reward decisions from the users. The software will mask traditional conventions of conducting surveys and
lab experiments allowing users to make genuine decisions. The game decisions made by the users will be logged on the server and saved which can be later used for research.

\subsection{Objectives}
The main objective of the VnV plan is to build confidence in the softwareâ€™s correctness. It outlines the plan to ensure the implementation of the system matches the project specification stated in other documents (listed in the section below). The plan for verifying the system's usability is also presented. This is important as users can trust that the software will perform as expected, which can lead to a better overall gaming experience.

 \quad Please note that all team members listed on the table will also have the role of code reviewers. This includes the supervisor, as he has to maintain the code in the future and should therefore have some oversight of the code itself.

The roles and responsibilities listed above can be viewed as the main responsibilities of the member. They will be questioned should the area be incomplete. However, there are no restrictions in collaborating with other members to finish their tasks. This will be especially useful during unforeseen circumstances. Furthermore, team members may also switch or trade responsibilities should all members agree. Overall, the table above is a starting point and gives the opportunity for members to take on or delegate tasks through the testing process.

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

SRS verification will be implemented in a variety of ways. First of all, reviews by classmates and teammates will be used in the form of the creation of GitHub Issues. Although this has been done before, we intend to continue verifying the SRS in this way. We will improve on the previous process by creating a checklist to guide a reviewer, to help improve the speed of reviews and guide reviewers towards areas that may need more attention. This checklist will be implemented in the form of a GitHub Issues template.

We will also use structured reviews from the project's supervisor to help verify the SRS. This will be carried out in the form of an SRS walkthrough, where all group members and the supervisor will meet and the group will guide the supervisor through the SRS document. The issues noted from the feedback will be addressed and resolved to improve the functional requirements, non-functional requirements and/or constraints of the product.

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

Design verification will be implemented very similarly to SRS verification. \\
Like in the preceding section, reviews by classmates and teammates will be used in the form of the creation of GitHub Issues. A checklist to guide reviewers will also be created, to help improve the speed of reviews and guide reviewers towards areas that may need more attention. This checklist will be implemented in the form of a GitHub Issues template.

We will also use structured reviews from the project's supervisor to help verify the design. This will be carried out in the form of a design walkthrough, where all group members and the supervisor will meet and the group will guide the supervisor through the design of the project, including drawing diagrams on a whiteboard and describing concepts in-depth where needed. The supervisor will be encouraged to give feedback during the walkthrough. The issues noted from the feedback will be addressed and resolved to improve the look and feel, and underlying game mechanics of the product.

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

Verification and Validation Plan verification will be implemented very similarly to the preceding two sections. \\
Like in the preceding sections, reviews by classmates and teammates will be used in the form of the creation of GitHub Issues. A checklist to guide reviewers will also be created, to help improve the speed of reviews and guide reviewers towards areas that may need more attention. This checklist will be implemented in the form of a GitHub Issues template.

Due to the nature of the Verification and Validation plan, we elected to use other classmates for structured reviews as well as the supervisor. Since other classmates have a more technical background than our supervisor, these structured reviews will help us improve the VnV plan document. The review from the supervisor will be equally for his purposes, so he is familiar with how we are testing the project. These structured reviews will be carried out in the form of VnV plan walkthroughs, where all group members and the supervisor will meet and the group will guide the supervisor through the design of the project, including drawing diagrams on a whiteboard and describing concepts in-depth where needed. The supervisor will be encouraged to give feedback during the walkthrough. 

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

  Implementation verification will be done using the dynamic and static tests outlined in this document. Namely, they consist of the tests for functional requirements in \hyperref[s5.1]{section 4.1} and the tests for nonfunctional requirements in \hyperref[s5.2]{section 4.2}. In future revisions of this document, unit tests from section 6 will also be used for implementation verification.
  
  Implementation verification will also be carried out through code reviews. When a group member makes a pull request to the GitHub repository, another member will have to approve it before it can be merged to the main (stable) branch.
  
  Finally, implementation verification will be carried out through a static analyzer. For now, this will just consist of running the linter used for the project (see \hyperref[s4.6]{section 3.6}). This can be set up either via GitHub Actions, or since the team size is small it may cost less time to simply require that all devs run the linter on their pull requests before opening them.

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}
\label{s4.6}

\begin{itemize}
\item For front-end testing and code coverage, we will use \href{https://jestjs.io/}{Jest}, \href{https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools}{React Developer Tools}, \href{https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/}{Lighthouse}. 
\begin{itemize}    
    \item Jest is very popular, however we will specifically use it for front-end testing as it provides a suite of useful features such as snapshot testing that can be used to ensure the layout of a page doesn't change.
    \item React Developer Tools will be used to assess front end performance, specifically render times. This will help identify components that may bottleneck the performance of the system.  
    
    \item Google's open-source built tool called Lighthouse will also be used to assess different accessibility features of the system, help shed light where users may have a bad experience with a particular part of the system. It is also known to be a good tool to assess different areas of performance such as memory and render times.
    
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Code coverage reports for the entire project will be generated as shown in Figure 1 below. \\
    \begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{CodeCoverage}
    \caption{A sample code coverage report}
    \end{figure}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}


 % One of the central purposes of this project is to gather research data through a user's gameplay. The supervisor, Prof. Niko Yiannakoulias, has done research before on the same topic, but through traditional survey methods instead of a game. The data obtained from his previous research will be important to validate the software, as it will help show if the software fulfilled its purpose of generating reliable data.

One of the central purposes of this project is to gather research data through a user's gameplay. The supervisor, Prof. Niko Yiannakoulias, has experience conducting research through games. We have a weekly meeting cadence set up with him and we can use these to iteratively validate the software as we go through the development process as opposed to validating it just once. In the beginning, it will be best to keep these review sessions less formal but as the software gets closer to the finished product, the review sessions will become formal in nature and the group will implement task based inspection.

\section{System Test Description}
	
\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}
\label{s5.1}

% \wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
%   different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
%   level of document structure can be removed.} \\
Game testing can be broken down into the following sections. The subsections will cover all the different components of the game. These components will work operate separately or work together to fulfill the functional requirements. Some of the components will be tested manually while others will require automated testing.


\subsubsection{Account Testing}

% \wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
%   cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.  If a section
%   covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
%   table in the SRS.}
The account creation testing deals with the test cases related that relate to a user account. FR1, FR2, FR5 and FR15 are the functional requirements that are covered by the subsection. The system requires you to have an account to play the game. The test cases include the following: creating an account, resetting password, logging in, verifying if the user is human and account deletion.

\section{Unit Test Description}
Most of the testing has to be done manually by ensuring correct things are being rendered on screen. There are a few components that require unit testing and these modules are key components of the game mechanics. The following section discusses the plan for testing these modules.

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}
The scope of unit testing was limited to the game components that could be automatically tested. The significance of the tested modules was determined by their contribution towards creating a minimum viable product.

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}
The following sections details unit tests for functional requirements. This is an important aspect of testing as it verifies whether the modules are behaving correctly given the requirements in the Software Requirements Specification. 

\subsubsection{GameMechanics}
  
The GameMechanics tests deal with automated tests that are crucial to testing the game mechanics. The main two components within the game are the shop and the inventory. The tests cover all the significant actions that can be performed in the game. Specifically the purchase and selling of crops which is the way to earn currency in game. The main goal of the game is to optimize your balance so these actions are necessary to achieve that goal. While the tests deal with just purchasing, it inherently is also testing the inventory as purchasing or selling includes adding or removing items from the inventory. The tests pertain to the Shop and Inventory Modules in the MIS.

\begin{enumerate}


\item {\textbf{Name:} Successful first item purchase\\} % FR 3, 6
\textbf{Id:} Test-GM12 \label{Test-GM12}\\

Control: Automated

\textbf{Initial State:} User is logged in and in the shop. User has enough in-game currency to purchase an item but does not have the item in their inventory

\textbf{Input:} User is logged in. The user buys an item

\textbf{Output:} The item appears in the user's inventory and the user's currency correctly reflects the outcome of buying items

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} The system must be able to verify that users can purchase a new item they do not currently own using in-game currency

\textbf{How test will be performed:} Automated test to check if purchased item exists in inventory and the user's currency is correctly reflected after the purchase, in both the database and front-end

\textbf{Requirements being verified:} FR3, FR4, FR6, FR16, FR17, C1

\item {\textbf{Name:} Unsuccessful item purchase\\} % FR 3, 6
\textbf{Id:} Test-GM13 \label{Test-GM13}\\

\textbf{Control:} Automated

\textbf{Initial State:} User is logged in and in the shop. User does not have enough in-game currency to purchase an item but does not have the item in their inventory

\textbf{Input:} The user buys an item

\textbf{Output:} The item does not appear in the user's inventory and the user's currency is not changed

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} The system must be able to verify that users can not purchase an item using in-game currency when they do not have enough in-game currency

\textbf{How test will be performed:} Automated test to check if the user has enough in-game currency to purchase that item which does not change after an unsuccessful purchase, in both the database and front-end

\textbf{Control:} Automated

\textbf{Initial State:} User is logged in and in the shop. User has enough in-game currency to purchase an item and already has the item in their inventory

\textbf{Input:} The user buys an item they already have in their inventory 

\textbf{Output:} The quantity of the same item is increased by 1 in the user's inventory and the user's currency correctly reflects the outcome of buying items

\textbf{Test Case Derivation: }The system must be able to verify that users can purchase items to use for farming purposes

\textbf{How test will be performed:} Automated test to check if purchased item count in inventory has increased and the userâ€™s currency is correctly reflected after the purchase, in both the database and front-end

\textbf{Initial State:} User is logged in, user is at the shop, and the user owns at least two of the same crop

\textbf{Input:} User sells the one of the crops in current season and the other in the next season

\textbf{Output:} Profit earned from selling the two of the same crops in different seasons should vary 

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} The user should be able to somewhat simulate a real market where crops can be sold at varying prices at different times and market

\textbf{How the test will be performed:} Automated test to sell two of the same crops during different time periods and ensure the prices are the different to check for random sell prices

\textbf{Requirements being verified:} FR3, FR4, FR9, FR10, FR16, FR17, FR21

\textbf{Initial State:} User is logged in, user is at the shop, and the user owns at least two of the same crop

\textbf{Input:} User sells the one of the crops in current season and the other in the next season

\textbf{Output:} Profit earned from selling the two of the same crops in the same seasons should be the same 

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} The user should be able to somewhat simulate a real market where crops can be sold at varying prices at different times and market

\textbf{How the test will be performed:} Automated test to sell two of the same crops during the same time periods and ensure the prices are the same to check for random sell prices

\textbf{Requirements being verified:} FR3, FR4, FR9, FR10, FR16, FR17

\textbf{Input:} Crop to be sold

\textbf{Output:} Money earned through selling crop. User's currency count correctly reflects the increase in user's currency count

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} The user should be able to somewhat simulate a real market where crops can be sold at varying prices depending on the time and market

\textbf{How the test will be performed:} Automated test to check if user's money/balance has increased after selling a crop

\textbf{Requirements being verified:} FR3, FR4, FR9, FR10, FR16, FR17

\item{\textbf{Name:} Successful decrease in item quantity after selling item\\} % FR 8 
\textbf{Id:} Test-GM18 \label{Test-GM18}\\

\textbf{Control:} Automated

\textbf{Initial State:} User is logged in, at the shop, and holds at least one crop in inventory

\textbf{Input:} User sells one crop

\textbf{Output:} The inventory count decreases by one and money earned through the sale is added to the user's in-game currency balance

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} The user should no longer have the same number of items once its sold

\textbf{How the test will be performed: }Automated test to check if crop that has been sold has been removed from the inventory

\textbf{Requirements being verified:} FR3, FR4, FR5, FR9, FR10, FR16, FR17

The team member will pursue following the in-depth tutorial as they will be able to learn the basics and apply these concepts when testing the backend.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Student: Mihail 
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mocha}: Two approaches to acquiring this knowledge would be to read documentation on \href{https://mochajs.org/}{Mocha} and following an in-depth tutorial \href{https://www.w3resource.com/mocha/getting-started.php}{Introduction to Mocha}. The team member will pursue following the in-depth tutorial as they will be able to learn the basics and apply these concepts when testing the front-end. They may refer to the documentation if they require knowledge not acquired in the tutorial.
        \begin{itemize}
                \item Student: Brandon
            \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Code Walkthroughs}: Two approaches to mastering and acquiring this knowledge would be to read a tutorial on \href{https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_testing_dictionary/code_walkthrough.htm}{code walkthroughs} and to try to apply this knowledge during a work session. The team member will read the tutorial to get a better understanding of the concept as there might not be sufficient time to properly perform code walkthroughs. The plan for conducting the walk-through will be the one of the team members will work through resolving an issue or completing a feature while at least one other team member will be present via call or in person to understand, assist or verify the work.
