\section{Introduction}
Based on Nancy Leveson's work, a hazard is any property or condition in The Farming Matters game that fails or alters its intended function when coupled with the environment. This document outlines the Hazard Analysis for the Farming Matters game. The Farming Matters game is an engaging way to collect authentic data to support the research study that focuses on whether or not people prefer probabilistic or deterministic information.


\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}
The scope of this document is to provide an analysis regarding hazards of the different system boundaries and components, how to mitigate each hazard, and provide safety and security requirements. It is important to note, the hardware of choice in which our system is run (i.e. the user's device), is beyond our control as players will play on their unique combination of physical hardware through a web browser. Accounting for all combinations is not possible, which ideally is not necessary as the system should be developed in such a way that it generally works as long as the player's setup can run a web browser. Similarly, it is assumed that all game mechanics and functionality work as intended, as it is impractical to account for all different combinations of input. Ideally, the normal operation would result in no, or at least minor, bugs that do not affect the logged data. The VnV report will ensure this. The team has focused to mitigate failures in the following components: Authentication System, Backend Server, Database System, and User Interface

\section{System Boundaries and Components}
The system will be divided into the following components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The application including both the frontend and backend consists of the:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Authentication System
        \item Backend Server
        \item Database System
        \item User Interface
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The physical setup (computer, keyboard, mouse, laptop)
\end{enumerate}

The authentication system component is responsible for allowing users to create an account and log in as well as allowing existing users to log in. The backend server component is responsible for handling all requests regarding the login system and database system as well as responding to these requests. The database system component is responsible for the handling of user data.

\section{Critical Assumptions}
There are no critical assumptions.

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}
The following requirements include requirements in the Software Specification Document. It also lists new requirements which will be added to the Software Specification Document and have been written in \textbf{bold}. 

\subsection{Security Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{SR}1. ]
    \item The system must not allow automation of creating accounts.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: It is important for the data collection of the study to not include robotic responses for the data to be as authentic as possible 
    \item \textbf{The system will encrypt all user passwords with a sufficient encryption algorithm.}\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: It is important for the data collection of the study to not have multiple people play on the same account for the data to be as authentic as possible 
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Access Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{ACR}1. ]
    \item \textbf{The frontend system shall allow access to any user.}\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: Unauthenticated users will need to authenticate themselves
    \item \textbf {The backend system shall only allow unauthenticated access to login-related functionality.}\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: Unauthenticated users will need to authenticate themselves
    \item \textbf{The backend system shall only allow access to authenticated users for all other (non-login) functionality.}\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: It is important for the data collection of the study for the data to be traceable to specific user accounts to be able to inspect their tendencies
    \item \textbf{The backend system shall allow only up to one user to have one user logged-in session at any point and time.}\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: It is important for the data collection of the study to not allow multiple concurrent sessions on the same account so as to not overwrite any data 
    
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Integrity Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{IR}1. ]
    \item \textbf{The system will be able to handle all API requests in API\_RESPONSE\_TIME}\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: From Human-Computer Interfaces, a maximum of 1 second wait time is needed for a user's flow of thought to stay uninterrupted
    \item \textbf{The system will be able to handle all database requests in DATABASE\_RESPONSE\_TIME}\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: From Human-Computer Interfaces, a maximum of 1 second wait time is needed for a user's flow of thought to stay uninterrupted
    \item \textbf{The system will be able to handle the unexpected loss of connection to the server}\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: It is important for the data collection of the study to not corrupt, lose, or overwrite any data
    \item \textbf{The user shall agree to the terms and conditions before using the application }\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: Users must agree to the terms and conditions of the study for the system to be approved by the ethics board
    \item \textbf{The system shall warn users regarding account sharing and how it will skew the data collection for research}\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: It is important for the data collection of the study to not have multiple people play on the same account for the data to be as authentic as possible 
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Privacy Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{PR}1.]
    \item \textbf{The system shall delete all user data if the user decides to opt out of data collection}\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: It is important that users can opt out of the study at any time for the system to be approved by the ethics board
    \item \textbf{The application only requires an email provided by the user}\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: User must account only require an email to be approved by the ethics board
\end{enumerate}
