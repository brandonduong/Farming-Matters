\section{Introduction}
This document outlines the Hazard Analysis for the Farming Matters game. The Farming Matters game is an engaging way to collect authentic data to support the research study that focuses on whether or not people prefer probabilistic or deterministic information.

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}
The system will be divided into the following components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The application including both the frontend and backend consists of:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Authentication System
        \item Backend Server
        \item Database System
        \item User Interface
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The physical setup (computer, keyboard, mouse, laptop)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}


%\wss{Include your FMEA table here}

         \hline
         Database & Server can not fulfill all user requests & Can't store all user decisions, losing data necessary for the underlying research study & Too many people playing and making API requests at the same time & Ensure a queue-login system  is enforced, only allow a max amount of users to play the game\newline   & IR1 & H1-1\\
          & Database can not store any more data & Can not store any user decisions, losing data necessary for the underlying research study & Storage of database is full & Admin's can download all data (user decisions) from the database and delete the data on the database afterwards, hence creating additional storage. Admins could also increase database storage capacity   & IR2 & H1-2\\
          \hline
         Authentication & Unauthorized user is able to log into the game & Logged player decisions cannot be traced to an account/user \newline & Database authentication issue & Ensure only authorized user decisions are logged & ACR2, ACR3 & H2-1\\
         & Bots are able to play the game & Logged decisions are inauthentic and detrimental to the underlying research\newline & Attacker develops script to automate account creation and play game &  Ensure account creation includes captcha & SR1 & H2-2\\
         & Account sharing & Logged decisions do not reflect decision-making of one person and are detrimental to the underlying research\newline & The user shares their account login information with their peers & The user must accept the guidelines and rules before playing the game & IR4, IR5 & H2-3\\
         
           & User opening multiple sessions & Logged decisions from current and previous sessions may be overwritten and thus lose data & The user logs in multiple times on the same device or on multiple devices & The user must log out before creating a new session or the system will automatically log them out of the old sessions in order to create a new session & ACR4 & H2-4\\

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

The following requirements includes requirements in the Software Specification Document. It also lists new requirements which will be added to the Software Specification Document and have been written in \textbf{bold}. 
\subsection{Security Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{SR}1. ]
    \item The system must not allow automation of creating accounts. 
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Access Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{ACR}1. ]
    \item test
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Integrity Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{IR}1. ]
    \item \textbf{The system will be able to handle all API requests in API\_RESPONSE\_TIME}
    \item \textbf{The system will be able to handle all database requests in DATABASE\_RESPONSE\_TIME}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Privacy Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{PR}1.]
    \item test
\end{enumerate}
