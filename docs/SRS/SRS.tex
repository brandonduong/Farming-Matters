This document describes the requirements for Farming Matters. The template for the Software
Requirements Specification (SRS) is a subset of the Volere ~\citep{RobertsonAndRobertson2012} template. \newline \\ Some modifications made to the Volere subset template are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item (Added) Section 3.10: Requirements that are likely/unlikely to change
    \item (Added) Section 4: Traceability matrix
    \item (Added) Section 5.5: Requirements Phase-In Plan
    \item (Added) Section 6.1: Team technologies/skills - Reflection
    \item (Removed) Section 5.11 Ideas for Solutions - Ideas for solutions are represented in the risks section, as mitigation is provided for each risk.
\end{itemize}



\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
The purpose of this project is to conduct survey research through an interactive and engaging activity. This will further help understand genuine decisions from the players to help with the research of understanding risk-making decisions.


\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{The Client}
The client of this project is Dr.Yiannakoulias who is the supervisor of this project. Dr.Yiannakoulias is part of the School of Earth, Environment, and Society at McMaster University.

\subsubsection{The Players}
Players are individuals that enjoy management and role-playing simulation games. As well as individuals willing to be a respondent to help conduct data for research.

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
Other stakeholders would include the Ethics board. Some of the requirements regarding data collection are derived from this stakeholder. They also have to approve the final product to check if there are any ethical issues.

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Description: The project shall have a budget of \$0.\\
    \textbf{Rationale:} The developers of the project have no budget for this project. The professor might purchase game assets if he wishes to change the look of the game after the game has been created.\\ 
    Fit Criterion: The developer team should use open-source and free software.
    \item Description: The project shall run properly on different operating systems like Linux, Windows, and Mac OS.\\
    \textbf{Rationale:} The project shall be portable.\\
    Fit Criterion: The player shall be able to run the game on different operating systems.
    \item Description: The client must present a consent form to participate in the study before starting the game.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: This is another requirement from both the Ethics Board and the client, and made this a point to emphasize.
    \item Description: The player must have the option of deleting their data.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: This is a requirement from the ethics board and players must be given this option.
    
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Player: The user playing the game. The player or user is the participant and focus of the study.
    \item Land: An area where the player can interact with the farm. This includes planting crops, fertilizing crops, and adding buildings.
    \item Inventory: Where the player will be able to store items.
    \item Items: The player will be able to acquire these into their inventory, including seeds, crops, and fertilizer.
    \item Seed: Seeds are planted on the farm and evolve into crops once harvested.
    \item Crop: Once fully grown, seeds evolve into crops once harvested.
    \item Fertilizer: It is used to reduce the number of turns to harvest a crop.
    \item Focus groups: A set of players will be involved with discrete decision-making and another set of players will be involved with probabilistic decision-making.
    \item Turns: these are rounds that happen per season where a decision can be made. 
    \item Seasons: Including Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall. The current season changes depending on the turn number, and has an effect on which crops can be grown. Each season lasts SEASON\_LENGTH turns.
    \item Key Questions: These are the compulsory questions that will be asked to the player. The first will be whether the player wants to pay the consultant for advice. The second question will ask the player if they want to purchase insurance for crops.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions about User Characteristics}

The relevant facts and assumptions regarding player characteristics mainly pertain to a player. The player should have the physical and visual ability to operate a computer. This includes actions such as clicking a mouse and pressing buttons on the keyboard. The player should be familiar with the hardware they are using, in this case, a desktop or laptop. It would be preferable if the player had some knowledge of the basic idea of farming; however, there will be a tutorial to go over the basic rules of the game if they lack sufficient knowledge on how to play. Due to the research-oriented nature of the project and the ethical requirements, all players will be over the age of 18.

\section{Functional Requirements}
The following section outlines the scope of the product, use cases, and functional requirements. Functional requirements provide the core function(s) that the system should have. They were elicited and confirmed through discussions with the client. A rationale is also provided for each requirement.

\subsection{The Scope of the Work and the Product}

\subsubsection{The Context of the Work}
The Farming Matters game will create interactive and engaging management and role-playing game. The player will be provided with risk-making decisions involving the management of their farm. The game will involve in-game currency where players will have the ability to buy and sell items from an in-game shop. The system will also track and save each player's decisions which will be available for them to see at the end of each turn. The player will also have the ability to customize their farm layout and place items within their available land.

%%% new subsection
\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{FR}1. ]
    %Other
    \item \label{FR1} The system must allow players to create an account.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: The purpose of the game is to track player decisions and be able to see which participant did what decision. For this to happen, players must be associated with an account.
    \item \label{FR2} The system must allow the player to reset their password.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: It is possible a player misplaces their password and loses all their account progress. This effectively removes the participant from the study and so this must be rectified.
    \item \label{FR3} The system must allow players to accumulate in-game currency.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: In-game currency acts as a performance metric, and also helps engage the player in planning for their future decisions. Optimizing what one should spend their in-game currency on is both parts of the study and the engagement of the game itself.
    \item \label{FR4} The system must allow the player to store their items in an inventory.
    \textbf{Rationale}: The player must be able to view the items they currently own.
    \item \label{FR5} The system must verify new players as humans.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: As anyone can make an account, the system is susceptible to related attacks. The system verifying a player as a human before creating their account may slow down these attempts.
    %Shop related
    \item \label{FR6} The system must allow players to purchase items from a shop.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: Helps engage the player with the feeling of being rewarded and a decision-making process of what to plan for the future.
    \item \label{FR7} The system must allow players to place in-season seeds on their land.\\
    % 17 seems to be a superset of 7 (may need to change at the end)
    \textbf{Rationale}: This will give the player more variability and control in terms of how they want to build their farm. It also restricts players from planting seeds in unsuitable seasons due to weather conditions.
    \item \label{FR8} The system must allow players to grow seeds on owned land.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: The player will only be able to sell crops so the seeds must be fully grown and harvested before selling.
    \item \label{FR9} The system must allow players to harvest the crops. Seeds will evolve into crops after the specified number of turns for each seed.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: This simulates the real-life growth process in farming. It also helps the players differentiate the different items that can be sold vs planted.
    \item \label{FR10} The system must allow players to sell owned crops at a fluctuating price. The fluctuating prices for each crop will be generated using a normal distribution with each crop having a different base price (mean) and fluctuation factor (standard deviation).\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: Helps to somewhat simulate a real market where crop prices fluctuate. This was also a requirement that was emphasized by the client.
    \item \label{FR11} The system must allow players to use fertilizer on planted crops.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: Helps the player to grow crops faster to anticipate any events that may destroy their crops.
    %Playing the game
    \item \label{FR12} The system must allow players to buy unowned land.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: Players may want to increase their chances of crop yield and may want to plant a variety of them to further increase their total balance
    \item \label{FR13} The system must prompt players for consulting advice every CONSULTING\_INTERVAL turns.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: This decision is one of the two key questions the research is looking at. Whether people are willing to pay for information, and for what information (i.e deterministic or probabilistic).
    \item \label{FR14} The system must allow players to buy insurance on purchased seeds.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: This decision is the second of the two key questions the research is looking at. Whether people are willing to pay for insurance, and in what circumstance (i.e from the start, or only after they've been affected by an insurable event).
    \item \label{FR15} Harvested crops in the inventory can expire after a certain number of turns, given by the crop type. Once a crop expires, it is removed from the inventory without any compensation.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: This prevents players from holding onto the crop indefinitely until the highest price, which would take away from the strategizing to maximize the profit.
    \item \label{FR16} The system must be able to log player decisions.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: This was a crucial requirement that was provided by Dr.Yiannakoulias who will be able to view these logs to analyze the data.
    \item \label{FR17} The system must be able to save the player's game state.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: This will give players the option to continue where they left off if they want to continue playing at another time.
    \item \label{FR18} The system must have a defined area of land for players to manage the farm.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: This will provide an environment in which players can visualize and interact with their farm.
    \item \label{FR19} The system must be able to assign a player to a specific focus group.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: This is essential for the research study to demonstrate whether or not people prefer deterministic or probabilistic information.
    \item \label{FR20} The system must include random events to occur EVENT\_OCCURRENCE.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: Helps engage the player by needing them to plan for the possible unknown.
    \item \label{FR21} The system must have the current season change over time.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: Helps engage the player as they must plan for what is possible during the different seasons in terms of what to plant, and what risks there are within each season.
    \item \label{FR22} The system must assign users to one of two information types: probabilistic or deterministic date. All information provided will be given by the assigned method. \\
    \textbf{Rationale}: The client would like to research whether the players prefer one type of method over the other. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Requirements That Are Likely/Unlikely to Change}

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Likely/Unlikely to Change Table}
    \label{tab:my_label}
\end{table}
\begin{itemize}
    \item FR1: This is unlikely to change as accounts are needed to associate a specific player to their game state
    \item FR2: This is unlikely to change as accounts will need a way to be recovered should they happen to lose access to it
    \item FR3, FR4, FR6, FR7, FR8, FR9, FR11, FR12, FR18, FR20, FR21: These are unlikely to change as these are the basic core game mechanics that define the desired game loop
    \item FR5: This is unlikely to change as the system must ensure humans are playing the game for accurate data collection.
    \item FR10: This is likely to change as the stakeholder may want to implement a different pricing method for selling items
    \item FR13, FR14, FR15, FR16, FR19, FR22: These are unlikely to change as they implement the essentials behind the research study aspect
    \item FR17: This is unlikely to players must be able to play the game over multiple sessions
    
\end{itemize}

    \item LF5, UH1, OE1, OE2: This is unlikely to change as these tackle the problem of having the application as accessible as possible
    \item PR1, PR2: These are unlikely to change to ensure user engagement is not sacrificed due to poor system response times
    \item PR3: This is likely to change as the uptime is dependent on how long the client chooses to conduct the study
    \item MR1: This is unlikely to change as it allows Dr.Yiannakoulias to tweak and further improve upon the finished product.
    \item LR1: This is unlikely to change as this is required for the ethics board to approve the finished product.

\section{Project Issues}
The following section outlines the all relevant issues related to the project. The following category of issues considered are Open Issues, Off-the-Shelf Solutions, New Problems, Tasks, Requirements Phase-In Plan, Migration to the New Product, Risks, User Documentation, and Training and Waiting Room.

\subsection{Open Issues}
N/A

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
Although there are games that are themed around farming, they do not provide all the aspects required for this project. Games like FarmVille and Stardew Valley provide an entertaining and engaging way to manage a farm. However, they do not provide information about player decisions nor are they targeted toward research. 

There are also lab experiments and surveys used for collecting data for the specified research area. The results from these methods often do not accurate information about how humans make decisions in real life. The subjects tend to complete these methods for the incentive which results in an inaccurate collection of data.

There aren't any off-the-shelf solutions available that address all aspects of this problem. The game must be engaging and collect information about risk vs reward decisions in managing a farm. The information collected must also match the format which can be used for research. The combination of information collection, an engaging game, and the visibility of logged information is unavailable off-the-shelf.

\subsection{New Problems}
\subsubsection{Effects on the Current Environment}
The game will be graphics intensive which may contribute to a lag on certain devices. This will be exacerbated if the machine is running numerous other applications. The main game decisions also need to be logged into a database which may contribute to a lag as well.

\subsubsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}
N/A

\subsubsection{Potential User Problems}
The learning curve play is an important factor that determines how many players play the game. As the game should depict real-life decisions needed to manage a farm, the game may be complex and contain many different aspects. Failure to provide an informative guide may result in a lack of understanding of how to play the game. Furthermore, it may also result in many players quitting before they have made any progress in the game.


\subsubsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May Inhibit the New Product}
A browser and an internet connection are required to play the game. It is not uncommon for one to lose an internet connection while using the browser. Players may experience a loss of connection as they are playing the game which will limit the product. The player may be able to interact with the interface of the game; however, none of the decisions will be logged nor will the game state be saved.

\subsubsection{Follow-Up Problems}
There will be a risk if the libraries get updated during the development. This may result in in-game features being unable to run or load.

The research may need to be updated that better targets the information being searched for in the game. The game may not be providing the information that is useful to the research. The game may need to be re-designed to better obtain the information needed for the research area.

\end{table}

We specified the following requirements: \hyperref[FR1]{FR1},\hyperref[FR3]{FR3},\hyperref[FR4]{FR4}, \hyperref[FR6]{FR6}, \hyperref[FR7]{FR7}, \hyperref[FR8]{FR8}, \hyperref[FR9]{FR9},\hyperref[FR18]{FR18} above that are considered to be a High priority because these requirements are essential to creating a minimum viable product. The remaing requirements are also High priority,  \hyperref[FR10]{FR10},\hyperref[FR13]{FR13}, \hyperref[FR14]{FR14}, \hyperref[FR15]{FR15}, \hyperref[FR16]{FR16}, \hyperref[FR19]{FR19}, \hyperref[FR22]{FR22}, because these are core elements of the research study.

The requirements that are Medium priority are related to the game mechanics and will allow a more enriching experience for the player.

The requirements that are Low priority are related to the additional ad-dons to the game that could further enhance the player experience and make the game more interesting

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
N/A

\subsection{Risks}
\begin{enumerate}[{R}1.]
    \item May experience lag when rendering 3D-models 
    \\ \textbf{Description:} When rendering 3D models for the crops there may be some lag if there are too many models and if it is run on a low-spec machine. As well as any other 3D models use to render the visual environment of the game. 
    \\ \textbf{Mitigation:} The assets will be preloaded upon logging in to avoid fetching and loading the 3D models on different re-renders. The player can also enable settings on their browser to enable hardware acceleration to make gameplay more smooth and reduce lag.
    
    \item Ethics board does not approve the project
    \\ \textbf{Description:} In order for the game to be used as a research tool, it must be approved by a regulatory ethics board. There is an extremely minor risk that the ethics board could not approve the project after the game is made.
    \\ \textbf{Mitigation:} Our supervisor is very knowledgeable about the ethics board requirements, so we worked closely with him to capture requirements that would ensure approval. \hyperref[FR15]{FR15} is the requirement that could help to mitigate this risk along with the constraint that allows players to delete their data.
    
    \item Game is not immersive
    \\ \textbf{Description:} The entire purpose of the game is to gather research data in a way where the player does not feel as if they are in a research environment. To do this, we need to ensure that the player has fun while playing and feels immersed in the game. There is a risk they may not, which would defeat the purpose of the game.
    \\ \textbf{Mitigation:} We are mitigating this risk by adding many gameplay mechanics and features that will ensure the player feels immersed. We are additionally looking at existing popular farming games to see what makes people feel immersed, and incorporating that into our design.
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Costs}
There are two costs for this project. The first is the graphical assets used in the game. We will have to pay an artist to create digital assets in the form of images, icons, etc. for us to use in the game. Based on discussions with the supervisor, the graphics for the game will be 2d. Taking this into account, we researched the costs of 2d digital art and there are several different price models. If we want custom assets, we will either purchase a set of assets, or we will pay an artist hourly to create them. Overall, graphical assets will cost no more than \$300 for a polished game. 
\\ \\
With this being said, we have decided to run the project with zero budget initially, and for that reason, we will use all free graphical assets. If the supervisor decides to pay for assets in the future, the system shall be designed in a way where the assets will be easily replaceable (as captured in \hyperref[MR1]{MR1}).
\\ \\
The second primary cost will be the operating cost of the servers needed to run the backend code. Our supervisor (Dr. Yiannakoulias) said that he would handle the hosting of the code on his end, so we should consider that an external cost (ie. it's not added to the project budget). Regardless, since this project does not need to be scaled to high levels of traffic, the operating costs should be low (less than \$50/year)
\\ \\
All other functionality can be achieved at no cost, by using open-source solutions. Therefore, the total cost to the group will be \$0.

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
Players will be presented with the following documentation and training throughout the game:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Menu With Gameplay Help:} The player will be able to access a menu that contains instructions on the overall gameplay, including the goals of the game, the actions that can be done in a turn, how to make money, etc.
    
    \item \textbf{Menu with controls:} The player will be able to access a menu that contains instructions on the controls of the game.
    
    \item \textbf{Tooltips:} Throughout the player's gameplay, any components which do not have a clear purpose will have tooltips when the player hovers over them.
    
    \item \textbf{Ethics Documentation:} The player will be given documentation about the ethics of the research and their consent, as required by the ethics board.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Waiting Room}
This section serves as a place to keep track of potential future requirements or functionalities that we may not have time to implement.
\begin{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Asynchronous multiplayer}: This will be an exciting feature as players will be able to compete with other players in terms of how efficient they were with their turns, and what decisions the other players made. Multiplayer gameplay is usually a feature found in most games today; however, it will be asynchronous so players don't have to wait on others before they can perform actions.
    
    \item \textbf{Mini-games}: This will be a fun in-game feature that aims to keep players enticed. Mini-games could be played for various reasons. This could be an enjoyable option to earn money for buying items required for their farm. It is also an additional feature to keep the players engaged and motivated to continue playing the game. Combined with asynchronous multiplayer, leaderboards could also be introduced to track minigame performance.
    
    \item \textbf{Visualizing Data}: The data logged and sent to databases could be graphed and visualized in many other ways. This would also be useful for analyzing the results of the experiment.

\section{Appendix}
The following section outlines miscellaneous information that may be required to understand the material discussed throughout this document. Such information includes Team technologies/skills and Symbolic Parameters.
\subsection{Team technologies/skills - Reflection  }
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{ReactJS}: To master this technology, the following members will go through an in-depth tutorial on ReactJS \href{https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html}{Tutorial: Intro to React} and complete a basic project that can be found on YouTube (i.e Create a basic sign-up/login-page) to exercise different components taught in the ReactJS tutorial. This will help in both the development of this project and future projects as ReactJS is one of the most popular frameworks used in web development. ReactJS is also very similar to other popular web development frameworks such as VueJS, so learning ReactJS will help with learning similar frameworks in the future.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Students: Mihail, Brandon, Namit, Andrew, Mohammad
        \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Team Management}: To master this skill, the following members will go through an online LinkedIn course about team management and effective team leadership \href{https://www.linkedin.com/learning/topics/leadership-and-management}{Leadership and Management Online Training Courses}. Another approach is to take on a leadership role when completing the mini projects above that will be done in small groups of 3 or 4 for each group. This skill was chosen because team management is a large factor in a project's success that is often overlooked and gaining experience now will help for any future projects.
        \begin{itemize}
                \item Students: Mihail, Namit, Mohammad
            \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Web Development}: To master this technology, the following member will go through a series of basic web development fundamentals and concepts such as \href{https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp}{HTML Tutorial}, \href{https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp}{CSS Tutorial} and \href{https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp}{JavaScript Tutorial} provided by W3Schools. As well, a mini project suggested above will be used to demonstrate the understanding and skills learned through the tutorials. This skill was chosen because this member had very little experience with this tech stack and learning this could be helpful for further projects and work.
        \begin{itemize}
                \item Student: Mohammad 
            \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ExpressJS}: To master this technology, the following member will go through an in-depth tutorial and documentation \href{https://expressjs.com/}{Express - Node.js Web Application Framework}. As well, a mini project suggested above will be used to demonstrate the understanding and skills learned through the in-depth tutorial and documentation. This technology was chosen because the following members had a small experience with Express.js and would like to further get a better understanding of middleware in web development, and routing, and ultimately better at server-side development. This will prove useful in the future as most web development projects require knowledge and the development of a backend. Express.js is similar to many popular backend frameworks, therefore if a future project's backend uses some other framework similar to Express.js, the student can still leverage their previous experience with Express.js.
        \begin{itemize}
                \item Student: Andrew 
            \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SQL Database}: To master this technology, the following members will go through an in-depth tutorial for \href{https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp}{SQL}. They will also get hands-on experience by working on a mini-project that will leverage SQL to demonstrate the understanding and skills learned through the tutorial. If needed, other team members with prior SQL experience can assist. This technology was chosen as it is relevant to the industry and will be used in the project. A database is another large component of many web development endeavors, and so exercising this skill can help design effective schema for future projects.
