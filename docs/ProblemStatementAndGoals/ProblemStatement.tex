\section{Stretch Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Asynchronous multiplayer}: This will be an exciting feature as players will be able to collaborate with other players. Multiplayer gameplay is usually a feature found in most games today; however, it will be asynchronous so players don't have to wait on others before they can perform actions.
    \item \textbf{Mini-games}: This will be a fun in-game feature which aims to keep players enticed. Mini-games could be played for various reasons. This could be an enjoyable option to earn money for buying items required for their farm. It is also an additional feature to keep the users engaged and motivated to continue playing the game.
    \item \textbf{Visualizing the data collected by the game}: The data logged and sent to databases could be graphed and visualized in many other ways. This would also be useful for collecting results for the experiment.
\end{itemize}
