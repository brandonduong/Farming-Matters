\section{Changes Due to Testing}

% \wss{This section should highlight how feedback from the users and from 
% the supervisor (when one exists) shaped the final product.  In particular 
% the feedback from the Rev 0 demo to the supervisor (or to potential users) 
% should be highlighted.}

\resizebox{5.5in}{!}{\begin{tabular}{|p{0.135\linewidth}|p{0.5\linewidth}|p{0.6\linewidth}|}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{|l|}{\bfseries Source} & \multicolumn{1}{|l|}{\bfseries Feedback} & \multicolumn{1}{|l|}{\bfseries Changes} \\
\hline
Supervisor (Survey) & Closing the shop or inventory is unintuitive & Added an X button on the top right of the shop or inventory modal \\
\hline
Supervisor (Survey) and TA & The tab buttons in the shop are unclear & Added hover and active effects to the tab buttons \\
\hline
Supervisor and TA & The tab buttons in the shop are out of place (i.e fixed to the top of the page) & Moved tab buttons to inside the shop modal \\
\hline
Supervisor (Survey) & The overall UI is not consistent & Changed the shop and inventory background colors to match the info header. Changed shop, inventory, and consultant buttons to match info header's \\
\hline
Supervisor and TA & The seeds in the shop are unclear (i.e what seeds can be planted in what season, how long do they take to grow) & Added hover to seed options that display the seasons it can be planted in and growth length. Seed options changed to have a background color that matches what season it can be planted in \\
\hline
Supervisor (Survey) and TA & The UI is unnecessarily cluttered when trying to sell items in the shop & Only items that you have at least 1 of are displayed when in the sell tab of the shop\\
\hline
Supervisor & The surrounding foliage on the farm is unattractive & Replaced tree model with grass model and flower model \\
\hline
Supervisor & There seems to be a possibility that the consultant options are overlooked & The consultant modal changed to automatically popup at the beginning of every season \\
\hline
Supervisor (Survey) & Needs more engaging audio & Added different background music for each of the 4 seasons. Added audio for button clicks, incrementing or decrementing money, harvesting crops, and planting the crop.\\
\hline
TA & Buying seeds are unclear. It seems like you are buying the full-grown plant rather than just the seed & The seeds in the shop have their icon and name changed to indicate they are seeds \\
\hline
TA & It is unclear what buying insurance on a crop does & Added a tooltip hover to summarize what buying insurance does \\
\hline
Test-DB3 & Loading a saved game not working properly & Fixed database schema to allow for loading of a saved game \\
\hline
Test-AC3 & Reset password flow does not provide email to reset password & Added reset password email notification that provides a link to reset password \\
\hline
Test-AC4 & Even if the user is flagged as a bot during a verification step, they are still permitted to login & Debugged login system and the integrated result of verification to deny login if failing \\

\quad There was a lot of feedback concerning the user interface and usability elements of the system. The team focused mostly on the functionality and core gameplay mechanics prior to the revision 1 demonstration. As such, the user interface elements were unpolished and many assets were placeholders. The supervisor and teacher assistants critiqued the elements, detailed in the table above, and provided insight into increasing the system's usability. The comments gave the team an initial direction for fixing the aforementioned issues. The team implemented these changes before the final demonstration and continues to work on improving the user interface. Although these issues have been resolved, this does not indicate that the user interface is perfect or near complete. As the product is used by more people, user testing will be conducted once again. The iterative process of feedback from the user and improving the interface will ensure the system is accessible and easy to use for everyone.

\section{Automated Testing}

Because we initially used \href{https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html}{create-react-app} to bootstrap our React application, \href{https://jestjs.io/}{Jest} was already set up as the test runner by default. Because of this, we decided to fully use Jest for all automated testing. It greatly simplified the setup of automated tests as all that was required was to create stubs of libraries that were incompatible with Jest.
\\

In order to automatically test functional requirements such as a user logging in, we used \href{https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/}{react-testing-library} to implement end-to-end testing. The library can be used to render components and simulate user interaction such as typing into an input field or clicking a button.

\section{Code Coverage Metrics}
Jest was used as a unit testing tool that also comes with an analysis of code coverage. As seen in Figure \ref{FigCC1} and Figure \ref{FigCC2}, at least 85\% code coverage has been obtained for the automated testing that was done. Thus, building confidence that most majority of the key areas in the code were run when testing these individual components. However, there was poor function coverage that was revealed in our automated testing because the team had prioritized testing more modules more thoroughly than others because some modules were much more significant in gathering research than others.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Reflection.  Please answer the following question:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
\end{enumerate}

One way the VnV Plan was different from what we actually conducted was that some tests were added and some tests were removed due to requirements changing. For example in the VnV Plan, we had planned to allow users to buy buildings. However, this functionality was removed later on in development as the team didn't see a need for them in terms of game mechanics. With this removal, the tests associated with this functionality were removed as well. Another change was with where we would store game logic. In the VnV Plan, we first had it such that clients would have to make requests to the server to do any game action such as buying or planting seeds, harvesting or selling crops, etc. The architecture now is that the game logic is stored and handled client side, and so performance testing of the game logic API requests was no longer needed.

These changes mostly arose from the fact that the team did not fully plan and discuss all game mechanics and how they would be intertwined with each other. They were mostly discussed in a vacuum rather than what role they would play in the encompassing game loop.

For future projects, we will further emphasize thorough planning of the entire product. This can be done by a number of visualization or planning methods such as sketches, storyboards, paper prototypes, or any other low-fidelity prototype. More communication with the client such as more meetings would also help iron out all the details of the project and reduce the number of changes or clarifications later on in development. However, even with all of this, there is still no guarantee that all possible changes are anticipated, which further highlights how important it is to minimize these possibilities.
